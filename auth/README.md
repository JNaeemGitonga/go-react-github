# Auth Service

This is a Node application (server). It uses TypeScript.<br>

A start script is used to determine how to start the app. We may need to run it in dev mode or production mode depending on the `NODE_ENV`.

**If you change any config files you will need to shut this container down, delete the lib folder and start the container over or you can kill them all and run the `run.sh` script.
